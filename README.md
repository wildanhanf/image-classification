# Image Classification
Using Convolutional Neural Network for image classification. Implementing image augmentation, EarlyStopping, Callback, and can predict the uploaded image. This project is for submission on Dicoding: Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [rockpaperscissors](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip)

## Criteria to fulfill
- The dataset used should be the following dataset: [rockpaperscissors](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip), or use this link in the wget command: https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip.
- The dataset should be divided into train set and validation set.
- The validation set size should be 40% of the total dataset (training data has 1314 samples, and validation data has 874 samples).
- Must implement image augmentation.
- Use image data generator.
- The model must use a sequential model.
- Model training should not exceed 30 minutes.
- The program is run on Google Collaboratory.
- Accuracy of the model must be at least 85%.
- Can predict images uploaded to Colab
